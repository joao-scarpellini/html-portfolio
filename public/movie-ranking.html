<p><h1>The best of that modern art</h1></p>

<p><h3>Dead poets society</h3>
One of the best movies made by man before, it tells the story of a revolutionary teacher called Mr. Keating, and his different view point of education, as a tool to build open minded citizens that know how to apreciate life and live for what's really worth.
<br />"Engieneering, medicine, law, arquitecture, those are noble persuits, necessary to human life, but poetry, romance, beauty, love, those, are the things we stay alive for"</p>

<p><h3>The perks of being a wallflower</h3>
A very  marking movie about a kind of alternative teenager that is entering high school and makes incredible friends that show him amazing things about the world and create him the feeling of being part of the group.<br />
It really communicates with me, because I lived something like what Charlie (the main character) lived, and I'm extremely greatful for what those friends showed me and made me feel.</p>

<p><h3>The man from earth</h3>
This movie has a unique recording style, as the whole movie passes only at his living room. It tells the story of a professor that unites his colegues in a farewall, and tell them that he is a Cro Magno that has 14.000 years.<br />
During the movie, his collegues tries to understand his story and know if its false or true.<br />
Very intellectual movie, with a lot of culture. I always revisit this movie to learn something different about human nature.</p>
